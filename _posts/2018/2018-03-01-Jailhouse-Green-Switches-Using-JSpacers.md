Jailhouse Greens (and blues) are a popular switch modification that makes significant changes to clicky MX-style switches. These mods can be performed on both Cherry and Gateron switches. 

The effect of the mod is to remove any pretravel between the stem and click mechanism by adding a rubber spacer between the two. By adding this spacer several things are accomplished:

+ No click
+ Switch is silenced
+ Switch becomes highly tactile
+ Tactile pressure  point is moved right up to the top of the switch

The jailhouse mod creates a very quiet, highly tactile switch. The feel is akin to heavier tactile switches like 78g Zealios. 

For this mod I used JSpacers from TheVanKeyboards. They are available for purchase [here](https://thevankeyboards.com/products/jspacers?variant=32991463758)
