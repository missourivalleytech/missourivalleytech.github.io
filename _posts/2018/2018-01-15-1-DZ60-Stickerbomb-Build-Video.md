About a year ago, I noticed a product on [1UpKeyboards](https://1upkeyboards.com/diy-tkl-2-plate-ss-sticker-kit.html) for a stickerbomb TKL layout keyboard. The kit on the site offered two metal plates and a pack of stickers. Prior to the stickerbomb TKL launch, I'd seen plenty of stickerbombed keyboards, usually folks slapping stickers on existing cases. I really fell in love with the TKL on 1UpKeyboards because it used a skeleton/sandwich design, a case made of just two plates. I loved the raw look of it, the pictures on the site looked more three dimensional that other stickerbomb boards I'd seen. It looked more _interesting_, it had depth, because you could see stickers on both plates, as opposed to just stickers slapped on a standard plastic case.

I loved the _look_ of the case, but not the layout. When it comes to standard staggered keyboards, I'm firmly a 60% guy. I simply have no interest in a TKL layout keyboard. Sadly, 1Up did not (and to date has not) offered a similar product in a 60% layout. I knew that to make one for myself, I'd have to endeavor to do my first **truly** custom keyboard case. I started doing research on how to have a custom plate made, and how to design one.

This board took a lot of time and effort to put together. I had been toying with, working on, and acquiring parts for this build for over a year. Given all the **true** custom work needed to build this board, I have a lot of pride in this build. This stickerbombed DZ60 feels great to type on, and is visually very striking. It's far from a 'clean' looking build, but it wasn't meant to be. This board was meant to be loud, and gaudy, and over the top - and it is.

A more in depth build log is [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/keyboards/2018-01-15-Stickerbomb-DZ60-Build-Log).
