I've decided to start doing typing videos of all my new keyboard builds. Every keyboard I've built or used has its own unique sound. Some are very 'pingy', others have a low chock sound, others are more crisp. Every keyboard feels different, every keyboard sounds different. It's worth documenting.

This board, my Iris with Alps SKCM brown switches produces a mostly low thock sound, with light pinging from some of the outer edge keys.
