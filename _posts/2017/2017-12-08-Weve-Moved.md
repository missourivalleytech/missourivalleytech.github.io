After a long time considering it, I have moved this website from the old missourivalleyambulance.com domain to missourivalley.tech.

Truth be told, this change was largely motivated by the simple fact that the old domain was _really_ long. Anytime I brought it up in conversation I had just the slightest embarrassment at the fact that the domain was so long and ridiculous sounding.

After a few years of having the old Ambulance domain it was time for a change. The new domain name is a lot shorter, and really gets to the heart of what this site is all about: technology.

With the change to the new domain I've made a few changes to under the hood of the site:

+ Comments are now enabled, using Disqus
+ FancyBox support has been added for images
+ Widgets for featured posts have been added to the homepage

In addition to the new domain, I've also rebranded the blog's twitter, follow it [here:](https://twitter.com/MoValleyTech).

I've also started a dedicated Youtube Channel for the blog. There aren't any videos up yet, but I've got a couple in the pipe, and will be making a push to make more video content for the site very soon.
