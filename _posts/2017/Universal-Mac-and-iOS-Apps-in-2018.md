Mark Gurman writing for [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps):

> Starting as early as next year, software developers will be able to design a single application that works with a touchscreen or mouse and trackpad depending on whether itâ€™s running on the iPhone and iPad operating system or on Mac hardware, according to people familiar with the matter.

The idea of unified apps (and potentially a unified operating system) has been discussed by many pundits and [myself]({{ site.baseurl }}/apple/2017-12-11-The-Unified-Platform) lately. Shifting to unified apps for iOS and macOS will make things easier for developers, they can write once and deploy to all the devices Apple makes.

If this comes at WWDC next summer, I would expect ARM based Macs running on A series chips to ship by the holiday season 2018.
