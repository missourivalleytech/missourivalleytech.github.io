Today I'm opening the BIG SERIES switch from http://novelkeys.xyz

This mechanical key switch is manufactured by Kailh, and is 4x larger than a normal switch. The switch is fully functional, and could be used to make a functional keyboard. The switch featured in this version is the tactile variant. Also available are clicky and linear switches.

The BIG SWITCH is [available for $30](https://www.novelkeys.xyz/product/the-big-switch-series/).
